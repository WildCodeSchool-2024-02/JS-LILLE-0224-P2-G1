        <h2>OUR BEER JOURNEY SO FAR</h2>
        <h3>
          The BrewCat story is a pretty wild tale. From small beginnings to
          global masterplans, here's a guide to our rollercoaster existence so
          far.

            2007 is the year our story starts with. Our founders James Watt and
            Martin Dickie decide they are fed up of the stuffy UK beer market…
            so, aged just 24, do something about it. Thanks to some very scary
            bank loans, the guys start making their own hardcore craft beers in
            Fraserburgh, a town in northeast Scotland. They brew tiny batches,
            fill bottles by hand, sell their first beers at local markets out of
            a beaten-up old van… and BrewDog is born. campaign image 2008 THINGS
            GET… WEIRD The banks are somehow persuaded to give James and Martin
            more money… which they use to mastermind the UK's strongest ever
            beer, Tokyo. The press go bananas, calling it “the downfall of
            Western civilisation”. The Portman Group (who make the rules for
            alcohol producers) ban our products. We carry on regardless, start
            exporting to Sweden, Japan and America and become Scotland’s largest
            independent brewery.

            We launched the ground-breaking Equity For Punks, offering people
            the chance to buy shares in our company. We continue to push
            boundaries by brewing the world's strongest ever beer, Tactical
            Nuclear Penguin at 32%. We also age a beer on the deck of a fishing
            boat and grow our business by 200%. The first BrewCat bar opens in
            Aberdeen, James and Martin's hometown. The BrewCat founders are more
            than a bit happy especially as we then win the Gold Medal for
            Hardcore IPA at the World Beer Cup. A slightly different reason to
            celebrate: brewing a 55% abv beer and packing it in roadkill, making
            it the world's most expensive ever beer. As you do. We also brew a
            beer at the bottom of the ocean, grow our business over 200% and
            launch Equity for Punks II. We raise more than £2.2m and welcome
            5,000 new shareholders. Side note: co-founder Martin dresses up as
            the Queen for our end of year video.

            <h4 className="years">2012-2014</h4>
            <br />A busy year, to say the least. We… open six new bars across
            the UK, get into a global media storm after Diageo cheat us out of
            an award, project ourselves naked onto the Houses of Parliament,
            make a special beer for the Olympics and launch the phenomenal Dead
            Pony Club. But the biggest news? We move from our cobbled-together
            brewery in Fraserburgh to a state-of-the-art brewery in Ellon. We
            launch Jack Hammer and double the size of our new brewery. Equity
            Punks III brings in 10,000 new investors from 22 different
            countries. We also 'break' America with our BrewCats TV show and
            open our first ever international bar in Stockholm with a Swedish
            funeral for generic beer. We create and release 36 different BrewCat
            beers, unleash Truck Norris on the world and ship our beers to 55
            different countries. We also open 12 new BrewCat bars as far afield
            as Brazil and Japan, as well as our first BottleCat and the awesome
            CatTap at BrewCat HQ.

            <h4 className="years">2015-2017</h4>
            <br />
            We open 17 new bars, including an epic new location in our home city
            of Aberdeen. We also install a kick-ass canning line at our Ellon
            brewery and release the strongest canned ale in the world: Black
            Eyed King Imp. Our most amazing year yet sees us brew 65 different
            beers and announce plans for the largest venture in BrewCat history
            taking on the USA with BrewCat Columbus and bring 82 new beers into
            the world. We also build a brand new brewhouse in Ellon, open nine
            new bars from Berlin to York and welcome 6,000 Equity Punks to our
            AGM. Oh, and we give away the detailed recipes to every BrewCat beer
            we’ve ever made. We also launch Equity for Punks V which takes our
            global community to over 70,000, begin brewing both in Columbus USA
            and at our standalone OverWorks beers in Ellon and announce our plan
            to build a BrewCat brewery in Brisbane, Australia. And we haven’t
            even mentioned the amazing release of Hazy Jane!

            The world's first craft beer hotel arrives! We open The Cathouse
            right next to our Columbus brewery in Ohio, as well as our very own
            beer museum. Equity for Punks V breaks the world record for equity
            crowd funding, closing at £22.6m. And we launch the BrewCat
            Blueprint a manifesto for the future, laying out our focus on beer,
            quality and people. As part of the redesign of our packaging, we
            announce BrewCat Tomorrow: a commitment to sustainability built to
            ensure we have a planet to brew beer on. We go big on expansion
            across the planet too, with new breweries in Berlin and Brisbane
            taking to us four across the globe. A challenging year for everyone
            but we make some big strides. Our distillers pause on making spirits
            to produce hand sanitiser, donating over 500,000 bottles to the NHS
            and local key workers. And we of course produce some new beer,
            including the iconic Barnard Castle, and a collaboration exclusively
            for ALDI ALD IPA.

            Our focus on planet comes to the fore, as we start work on our
            anaerobic digestion plant and launch BrewCat & Friends, the world’s
            most sustainable beer club. Two new hotels open. We announce plans
            for a Las Vegas brewery and our biggest ever venue, at London
            Waterloo. Equity for Punks Tomorrow raises an eye-watering £30.2m…
            We open our two biggest and most iconic sites the bars in Waterloo
            Station and on the Las Vegas strip and HQ gets bigger with a new
            brewhouse and a state of the art distillery. We also celebrate the
            15th birthday of the beer that started it all and cause QUITE a stir
            by naming ourselves anti-sponsors of the World F**k Up in Qatar.
            Black Heart, Shore Leave and Wingman are all released to the world
            and make a massive splash. We also launch NanoCat, to ensure we keep
            producing the innovative and exciting new beers we’re known for.
